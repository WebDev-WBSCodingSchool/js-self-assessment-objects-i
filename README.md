# JavaScript Self‑Assessment

Welcome! This mini‑project lets you check your JavaScript fundamentals without needing an instructor to grade your work. Clone or download the repository, complete the function stubs in **src/studentFunctions.js**, then run the automated tests.

## How to use

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

2. Install testing extension:

Head over to the VSCode marketplace and install the [Playwright Test for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright) extension

3. Run the tests:

Head to the `Test Explorer` view in VSCode:

<img src="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/python/testing/test-explorer-no-tests.png">

You should see a list of tests you can run in batch or individually.

Run them all!

Alternatively, you can run the tests in the terminal with `npm run test`

4. Iterate: Use the test feedback to debug and improve your solutions.

> Note If you open the folder in VS Code, the workspace automatically disables GitHub Copilot so that the assessment remains fully your own work.

## What you will practise

- Writing clean, idiomatic JavaScript functions

- Working with numbers and sequences

- Using basic control flow and algorithms

- Running and interpreting automated tests
